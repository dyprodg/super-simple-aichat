this is just a simple vite react app for localhost for api requests towards AI Chats

super simple, just run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to start the server
```
if you wanna use groq like id did in the example, you need to create a file called `.env` and add your own sanity project id and dataset name
```

in there you need to add the following:
```
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
you can get the key from groq cloud
